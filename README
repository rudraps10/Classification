# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign** using different machine learning models. The dataset used contains diagnostic measurements of breast cancer cells.  

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of **31 features** including mean, standard error, and worst values of cell nuclei properties such as:
  - Radius
  - Texture
  - Perimeter
  - Area
  - Concavity, etc.
- Target variable:  
  - **0 → Benign**  
  - **1 → Malignant**

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted categorical/object data to numerical (label encoding)
   - Outlier treatment using IQR method
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized class distribution
   - Correlation heatmap of features
   - Boxplots & histograms for feature analysis

3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix Heatmap
   - Comparison of Logistic Regression vs KNN

## 📊 Results
- **Logistic Regression**  
  - Accuracy: **99.41%**  
  - Precision: **100%**  
  - Recall: **98.41%**  
  - F1 Score: **99.2%**

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  - Accuracy: **95.32%**

➡️ Logistic Regression performed exceptionally well with near-perfect performance, while KNN gave decent results.
